# Pokémon Project
Welcome to the Pokémon Project!  
Catch ‘em all (or at least browse and search them) with a fun card layout, bouncy colors, and a smooth search bar. This is a simple, responsive web app built with React and JavaScript — and you can even add a bouncing pokeball if you want!

## What’s Included
- Search for your favorite Pokémon
- View Pokémon in pretty, responsive cards
- Fun hover effects and bright highlights
- Super simple interface, works on mobile
- Optional: animated pokeball bouncing across your screen for a bit of fun

## How to Use
1. Clone this repo:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/ayushi-rolt/pokemon-project.git
    ```
2. cd into the pokemon_react folder and run the command `npm run dev`
3. Start typing a Pokémon name in the search bar — cards show up below!
4. Try hovering on different cards to see the animations.

No complicated setup or installations. Just open, search, and enjoy.
